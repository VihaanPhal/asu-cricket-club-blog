## Story of the game (3–5 min read)

**ASU’s new-look attack set the tone immediately.** Ball one of the day thudded into the pad—**lbw**—and KCC were 0/1 before the scorers had settled. That opening burst, followed by a steady squeeze through the powerplay, left the Cavaliers forever rebuilding. Middle-order starts came and went, but ASU kept landing their plans: hard length, straight fields, and no freebies.

**Aarav Kapoor** was the spearhead, picking off three through the middle as KCC searched for momentum. Support acts from **Aditya Batra**, **Aryan Shetty**, **Abdul Rehman** and **Tanishqq Mishra** meant there was no release either; extras aside, boundaries were rare and singles were hard-earned. When the 20 overs were up, **KCC had posted 75/7**, a total that always felt light on a good surface.

The chase was a statement. **Yashashwi Gautom** walked out with intent, and the run-rate never dipped. He drove on the up, pulled anything fractionally short, and kept the scoreboard buzzing. With **Anshul Kaithakkal** for early company and **Soorya Sathish** later, Yashashwi finished unbeaten on a brilliant **56\* (25)**—the winning hit arriving **inside the 7th over**. Clinical, controlled, convincing.
