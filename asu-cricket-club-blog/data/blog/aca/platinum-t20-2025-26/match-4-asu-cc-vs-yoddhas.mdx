## First innings — Yoddhas kept to 128/8

ASU’s new-ball pair set the tone. **Vihaan** struck in the second over—caught behind to remove opener **Gaurav Lamba**—as Yoddhas crawled to **2/1** after two. Tight lines from both ends meant the powerplay never got away from us.

Yoddhas rebuilt through the middle overs. **Pawan Mahalkar (25 off 23)** and **Ved Agarwal (26 off 17)** found pockets and the occasional release shot, while **Kritin Kondru (17 off 11)** added a late burst. But every time momentum flickered, ASU hit back: **Abdul Rehman** bowled **Sachin Mahajan** to end a dour start, later pouching a sharp **c&b** to stop the late surge. **Tanishq** hit timber in the 17th, and **Yashashwi**’s death over (19th) produced two wickets—including Ved—to cap a superb finish.

**Bowling returns (selected):**

- **Abdul Rehman** 4–0–24–2 (including a c&b and a death over)
- **Yashashwi Gautom** 4–0–20–2 (two in the 20th)
- **Vihaan** 4–1–19–1 (new-ball strike)
- **Tanishq Mishra** 3–0–28–1
- **Aarav Kapoor** 3–0–17–1

**Yoddhas 128/8** felt 15–20 light on a good strip given how well we closed the last five.

## Chase — steady, then decisive

Openers **Anshul Kaithakkal** and **Yashashwi** took the sting out early—**29/0 after 6**—leaving a run-a-ball ask with wickets in hand. Yashashwi fell in the 9th (caught), but Anshul countered almost immediately with a clean six and kept the board moving. A brief wobble came when **Vihaan** was run out backing up, yet the dugout stayed calm: the ask remained around 7–8s with resources in the shed.

The chase flipped decisively in the **16th over**: two towering sixes and a brace off Sundeep’s medium-pace yielded **15**, dragging the required rate under control. With **12 needed off 12**, the 19th over began with an emphatic **first-ball six**, and cool heads knocked off the rest to close it in **19.0 overs**.

**Batting beats:**

- **Anshul Kaithakkal ~35 (37)** anchoring knock with timely boundaries
- Opening stand to **24/0**, then **29/0 after 6** set the platform
- **Death-overs composure:** 16th over for **15**, 19th over finished with **11** (first ball for six)

**ASU CC 129/4 (19.0)** — clinical, composed, professional.

## What this win says

This was the blueprint: **discipline with the ball**, especially at the death, then **trusted tempo with the bat**. We didn’t chase the game; we managed it. With a long tournament ahead, this is the kind of measured performance that travels.
