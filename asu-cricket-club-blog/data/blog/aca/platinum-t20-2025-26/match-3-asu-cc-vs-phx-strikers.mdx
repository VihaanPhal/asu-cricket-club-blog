> **Status:** **Abandoned** — Heavy rains in Arizona (yep, really!) meant no play was possible, and the **points were split**.

## What happened

The covers went on early as a stubborn band of rain parked itself over the ground—rare for Arizona, and a little funny if you’re not the one warming up in spikes. Umpires waited through multiple inspections, but with the outfield saturated and more showers inbound, the call was made: **no toss, no start, no play**.

- **Scheduled:** Platinum T20 2025–26, Phx Strikers vs ASU CC
- **Result:** Abandoned (0/0, 0.0 ov)
- **Points:** Shared between both teams

## Why it matters

It’s a small detour, not a derailment. The table stays tight, everyone gets a breather, and we roll into the next fixture with bodies fresh and spirits high.

### Silver lining

We got our “it never rains in Arizona” joke out of the way in September. Onward. 🔱
