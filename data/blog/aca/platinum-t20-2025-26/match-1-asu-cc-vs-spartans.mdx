> **Result** â€” Spartans 130/9 (20) vs **ASU CC 133/3 (15.5)**, **ASU won by 7 wickets**.

## The story (3â€“5 min read)

A fresh season, a new ball, and the Sun Devils looked switched on from ball one. Spartans won the toss and chose to bat, but ASUâ€™s seamers hit their lengths and kept a tight lid on scoring through the powerplay. **Abdul Rehman** swung the game early with a double-strike in the 5th over, removing Rajesh Devaraj and Karthick Shekar to leave Spartans three down inside five overs. From there, the bowling unit stayed disciplined and ground the innings down to **130/9**.

The chase was calm and clinical. The top order laid a platform and **Soorya Sathish (24 off 21)** found timely boundaries to keep the asking rate in check. In the middle overs, ASU pressed the accelerator: a flurry of boundaries and back-to-back sixes in the 13th over broke the game open. **Vihaan Phal (44\* off 17)** then iced it with clean striking, and the target was knocked off in **15.5 overs** â€” exactly the kind of ruthlessness you want to start a campaign.

## Turning points

- **Abdulâ€™s double in the 5th** â€” two wickets in an over to derail Spartansâ€™ rebuild.
- **Back-to-back sixes in the 13th** during the chase â€” momentum fully to ASU.
- **Sharp run-out** late in Spartansâ€™ innings (direct involvement from the keeper) to keep them to a below-par 130.
